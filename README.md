# Compound-Interest-Calculator
After taking an input, it returns the amount after a given amount of time

The interest it can do are: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually. These are marked as and lablled clearly in the program as 1-5.

What I've learnt/improved on:
  working with dictionaries

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Compound-Interest-Calculator.git

cd Compound-Interest-Calculator

python compound_interest_calculator.py

Alternatively you should be able to download the file and run it if you have python already installed.
